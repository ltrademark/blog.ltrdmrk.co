## Hello, Again

Soooo it's been a while since I've written anything of interest or meaning. Honestly, this isn't anything that special either. However, I have always to have a sort of space to jot down my ramblings.

Not to mention this is also giving me to excuse to design/develop/learn something else once again. Y'know, something to keep my career and skills engaged (and not stale).

A lot has happened since, I've updated or written anyone. I have:

  1. Kept my social accounts very quiet, will little to **no** posts (Twitter and mastadon being _some_ exception)
  2. Deleted my primary facebook account, For good.
  3. Deployed website redesigns a few times (and late!)
  4. Got a onewheel
  5. Broke my leg, subsequent of riding onewheel
  6. Been at my current job for what feels like forever at this point (6+ years ðŸ‘€)

And thats just to name a few. Obviously a LOT has happened since *2014*, but I guess in some way, I've become more cynical towards the internet, & online life.

well, it's almost 3am and all I've done is attempt at learning Eleventy and Nunjucks (which is the primary infustructure behind this... blog) and I feel like I havent gotten very far.

Anyway, I hope you all have a goodnight, or morning, and I'll catch-up another time.
