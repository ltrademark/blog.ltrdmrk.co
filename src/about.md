# Hello there

## My name is Leo

I'm an all-around creative, with a focus on interface design, and the occasionally illustration. I'm also fairly proficient in some front-end stacks. I've been working professionally as a Product designer for the better half 5 years, at a small start-up in northern Virginia.

During this time, I've worked with various clients on web projects, designed internal module systems, created some icons, and even made some in-venue display for some sports teams.
